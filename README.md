# Flights Graph

Language: C#

This project represents a map of flights that connect different cities. Each city is a vertex, and each flight is an edge in the graph. 
It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the 3 shortest paths (either by time duration, or by total distance) between a given 2 cities.
